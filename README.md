Introduction

  Lithofacies identification is a process that allows the determination of the hydrocarbon bearing zone. So, the potential resource can be developed and produced. The ideal sources for lithofacies classification are core samples of rock extracted from wells within the field. However, core samples are not always available due to the associated cost. Indirect measurement such as well logging emerges as an alternative method to classify facies. Nevertheless, the interpretation of these well logs is a mammoth task which highly needs experience expert to interpret the measurement and convert it to the meaningful data. The application of machine learning is a promising method facilitate the lithofacies classification process. 
  
  The objective of this capstone project is to investigate the performances of variety machine learning model, so the best model can be determined.
  
Data
The data used in this project is obtained from Alberta Geological Survey. it is a data collection of 2193 wells to map the McMurray Formation and the overlying Wabiskaw Member of the Clearwater Formation in the Athabasca Oil Sand Area
